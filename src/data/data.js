    Desc: "Embrace the bold flavors of Sichuan with our authentic Mapo Tofu. Silky soft tofu is delicately cooked in a fiery, piquant sauce of ground pork, Sichuan peppercorns, garlic, and fermented black beans. This spicy, mouth-numbing dish is perfectly balanced with fragrant green onions and a hint of sesame oil, offering a delightful challenge to your taste buds. Best enjoyed with a side of steamed rice.",
